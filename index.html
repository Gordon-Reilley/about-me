        Short summary of myself:
      </h2>
      <p>
        My full Name is Gordon Patrick Reilley Jr. This quite possibly is the most Irish name you will ever here, but you might not even realize I am Irish by looking at me. This is because my Mother is Native American and I resemble her greatly. Strong genes I guess! I am married and have an 8 month old baby boy and yes he is the III (third). I am currently living in Maryland learning to code at Code Fellows to try and land a job in the tech industry. I love the outdoors as much as I love being at the computer, the challenge is balancing the two! With all that being said, I hope you learned a thing or two about me and enjoy the rest of my page!
